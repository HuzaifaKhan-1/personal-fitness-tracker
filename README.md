# personal-fitness-tracker
The Personal Fitness Tracker is a Streamlit-based web app I developed during my internship with AICTE. It predicts calories burned using age, gender, BMI, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, it leverages a Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions and data insights.
